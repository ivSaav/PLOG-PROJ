## Description
The objective of this game is to lay stepping stones (rings) for the player's trio (balls) in order to 
to walk and vault their way onto the oposite board corner.

The game consists of one gameboard depicting a 5x5 grid, 6 balls (3 white and 3 black) and 16 rings (8 in white and the other 8 in black).

### Rules
+ Each player has access to 3 balls and 8 rings of the color they choose.
+ Once a component - ring or ball - is at play it may never leave the board.
+ A ball can only sit directly on a ring of the same color.
+ A component is only allowed to move to adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent) tiles.
    - If an ajacent tile has another component the player can vault over it.
+ Once a ball reaches one of it's goal spaces, it never leaves that space.

### How to play
In each turn the player should:
    1. Place or move one of his rings;
    2. Move one of his balls.
If the player is unhable to perform one or more of these steps, then he is out of the game.

#### 1- Ring Placement
The player can place a new ring from the supply, or move one of his exposed rings (the ring cannot have a ball or another ring on top).
The destination can be any space that does not have ball on top, and if that space already has a ring on it then the player must place is ring on top.

#### 2- Ball Placement
At his turn the player can move one of his balls that has not reached the goal spaces, either by moving it to an adjacent ring or by vaulting over 
other adjacent balls.
When the player vaults over another player's ball, then he must relocate it to a space of his choosing (as long as it has a ring with the same color as the ball being relocated). If there is no valid vault then the ball remains where it is.

#### End Game
The game ends when one the player gets all 3 balls on the opposite corner of the board.

### Game Representation
#### Elements
Every board piece is represented by an atom. In order to print every element to the console we call the predicates listed bellow.
    
    elem(c, C) :- C = ' _'.   % board corner (goal space)
    elem(wb, C) :- C = 'WB'.  % white Ball
    elem(bb, C) :- C = 'BB'.  % black Ball
    elem(wr, C) :- C = 'WR'.  % white ring
    elem(br, C) :- C = 'BR'.  % black ring

#### Board
The board consists of a list of lists. A row is represented by a list of lists aswell, in which the interior lists (stacks) represent each cell of the board. In our game a cell can have more than one element in it and because of that we decided that the best way of representing a cell would be a stack. The first element of the cell is the top of the stack and the last is the bottom.

    /*Initial board*/
    initial([
        [[       ],[       ],[],[wb,wr,c],[wb,wr,c]],
        [[       ],[       ],[],[       ],[wb,wr,c]],
        [[       ],[       ],[],[       ],[       ]],
        [[bb,br,c],[       ],[],[       ],[       ]],
        [[bb,br,c],[bb,br,c],[],[       ],[       ]]
    ]).

    /*Intermediate board*/
    intermediate([
        [[       ],[     ],[     ],[c         ],[c         ]],
        [[       ],[     ],[wb,wr],[wr        ],[bb,br,wr,c]],
        [[       ],[     ],[wb,wr],[br        ],[          ]],
        [[wb,wr,c],[bb,br],[bb,br],[wb,wr     ],[          ]],
        [[c      ],[c    ],[     ],[          ],[          ]]
    ]).

    /*Final board*/
    final([
        [[       ],[        ],[  ],[bb,br,c ],[bb,br,c   ]],
        [[       ],[        ],[  ],[br      ],[bb,br,wr,c]],
        [[       ],[        ],[wr],[        ],[          ]],
        [[wb,wr,c],[wb,wr,br],[  ],[        ],[          ]],
        [[wr,c   ],[wb,wrc  ],[  ],[        ],[          ]]
    ]).

### Console Visualization
Our board consists 5x5 matrix in which the columns are numbered from 1 to 5 and rows are named from A to E.
As a simplification our displayGame function only prints the top element of the board. It would be redundant to print the bottom elements, because if for instance we have a Black ball on top then we know that there must be a black ring bellow. By doing this we reduce the ammount of useless data on the screen which would only make it more confusing.

The displayGame function starts by printing the column indexes and then calls the printMatrix function which receives a list and a letter for row identification.
The printMatrix accesses each row and calls the printLine function whoose job is to print each board cell.

#### Initial State
Each player starts with 3 balls positioned in the board's corners.

#### Intermediate State
In this state the both player have reached one of the goal spaces for their balls (WB in D1 and BB in B5).

#### Final State
In the final state the player with the black pieces reached the goal spaces with all of his 3 balls first, so he wins the game.
